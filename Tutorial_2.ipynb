    "Tabular data is how a lot data is organized. It is not the *only* data format, but it is the easiest to work with because it is well-structured. Other data formats you will come across include [JSON](http://www.json.org/), [Relational and Non-Relational Databases](https://www.mongodb.com/scale/relational-vs-non-relational-database), images, and audio files. And believe it or not you are already familiar with tabular data, it's simply a table with columns and rows. Just like in Excel.\n",
    "\n",
    "As data scientists to-be, however, we need to make define some terms. We will often refer to rows as *observations* or *records*, and columns as *variables* or *features*. The *header* is the top row containing the names of our variables. In the example below our variables are country, salesperson, order id, and so on. Our observations are individual orders with those variable values. Our header, in this case, would be the row with index #1.\n",

We will then check it, coerce the variables to the correct format, check for missing values, and create aggregate reports by conditional selection. Then you'll follow the same pipeline on your own with a different dataset!\n"
