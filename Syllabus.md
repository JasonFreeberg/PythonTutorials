## Data Science at UCSB

### Fall Quarter, 2016

### Introduction to Python for Data Science

### Instructor: Jason Freeberg

This quarter's tutorials will be the *best* yet! As you can see I've made a complete syllabus, a Jupyter notebook for each tutorial, and laid the [foundation](https://github.com/JasonFreeberg/StreamTweets) for your own personal projects. As the title says, we will learn the basics of Python for data science and data analysis. That includes OOP, the NumPy, pandas, and scikitlearn modules, feature engineering, and an introduction to machine learning. **Now you might have some questions...**

*Why should I learn Python?* Well...
- It's a [popular](http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2016) language.
- It's [very](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/05/r-vs-python-data-science.html) popular in the data science and analytics industries.
- You can use it to access [Spark's API](http://spark.apache.org/). 
    - Spark is a distributed computating framework built with support for SQL, streaming, and machine learning. 

*Are you qualified to teach this?* [Yes.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jfreeberg)
 - While interning at Impact Radius, I wrote PySpark code to analyse massive data sets (PySpark = Python + Spark).
 - I like to write Python code in my free time. We'll use one of my Python projects as the foundation for your own.
 - Python is **not** a hard language to learn... or teach!

#### Class requisites:
- Basic programming knowledge or concurrently taking a programming class
    - Or quickly complete the Codecademy [Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python). 
- Accounts for the following wesbites:
	- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)
        - $9.00/month for student version
	- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
        - Good source of fun datasets
	- [Github](https://github.com/)
        - So you can get the tutorial notebooks

#### Week 1: “Welcome”
- Club information night! Ask questions, sign up, and pay dues
- Homework: 
	- Download and install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/), and [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
		- Download the right versions for **your OS**
        - If you get stuck just Google *"How to install ____".* Get good at phrasing your questions effectively.
        - Feel free to use a different editor. I use PyCharm and it works with the Jupyter notebooks. If you decide to use a different editor it's your responsability to make sure it can edit Jupyter notebooks.
	- Make GitHub, DataCamp, and Kaggle accounts
	- Clone the [tutorial repository](https://github.com/JasonFreeberg/PythonTutorials) to your computer
        - Here's [a guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE) to basic GitHub commands, I suggest against using the GUI.

#### Week 2: “Getting Started with Python”

- Using [pip](https://packaging.python.org/installing/) and [conda](http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/pkgs.html) to install modules
- Python Basics: syntax, objects, classes, modules, and data structures
- Homework:
    - *Optional:* [Codecademy course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)
    - ...

#### Week 3: “Tabular Data, Your New Best Friend”
- Practice loading a .csv file
    - With the help of pd.read_csv( )
- Handle missing values
    - And *wrong* values
- [Conditional selection](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/indexing.html)
- Homework:
	- …

#### Week 5: “Basics of Prediction”
- Machine learning at a high level

- Homework:
    - …

#### Week 4: “Feature Engineering”
- Creating new columns
    - [Standardization](https://www.biomedware.com/files/documentation/Preparing_data/Why_standardize_variables.htm)
    - [Variable interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interaction_(statistics))
- Mutating existing columns
- [Lambda functions and mapping](http://www.python-course.eu/lambda.php)
- Fill out course evaluations
- Homework:
	- …

#### Weeks 6 to 9: Begin Mini Projects
