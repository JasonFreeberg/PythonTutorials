# PythonTutorials

These are the Jupyter notebooks I use to teach the basics of Python for data science at our club meetings. I cover the basics of OOP in Python, tabular data, and the pandas and NumPy libraries. During the second half of the quarter, students group up and use the tutorial time to work on a guided project, or start their own and get help from me or their peers.

The tutorial syllabus for Fall 2016 will be added soon.
