    "Welcome to the club! This quarter we will write Python code to load, manipulate, and analyze data using the pandas and NumPy packages. The labs and corresponding notebooks are designed to *supplement* what you will learn from DataCamp.com. You will learn Python syntax on their website, and reinforce it in lab. To put it another way, the labs assume that you are keeping up with the assigned DataCamp.com tutorials. Towards the end of the lab you will **work in groups of 3 or 4 on quick exercises**. Weeks 6 through 10 will be focused on a small-scale group project.\n",

The schematics tell the employees where to put each piece, the starting values for things like the speedometer, fluid tanks, and so on.
